description: "Can You Forgive Her? is a novel by Anthony Trollope, first published\
  \ in serial form in 1864 and 1865. It is the first of six novels in the Palliser\
  \ series, also known as the Parliamentary Novels.\nThe novel follows three parallel\
  \ stories of courtship and marriage and the decisions of three strong women: Alice\
  \ Vavasor, her cousin Glencora Palliser, and her aunt Arabella Greenow. Early on,\
  \ Alice asks the question \"What should a woman do with her life?\" This theme repeats\
  \ itself in the dilemmas faced by the other women in the novel. Lady Glencora and\
  \ her husband Plantagenet Palliser recur in the remainder of the series.\nThe satirical\
  \ periodical Punch mocked the work, referring to it as Can You Stand Her? due to\
  \ its writers' irritation at Alice's ineptitude in deciding between her two suitors.\
  \ In his memoir about writing, Stephen King pokes fun at the book's length, joking\
  \ that for modern audiences a more appropriate title might be Can You Possibly Finish\
  \ It?\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
